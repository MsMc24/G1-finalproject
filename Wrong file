1. T asks the Ss to look at the title and pictures from the story and asks Ss to guess and predict what the story is about.☁️☁️☁️
<p>
2. T generates a word cloud for Ss (made using Wordcloud app). It emphasizes that the biggest words are the most mentioned keywords in the story. 
<p>
<em>What do you think Maria’s dream job is (related to <strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">art</span></strong>)? What does she need to achieve her dream?</em> 
<p>
3. T previews the target vocabulary and asks what words Ss may know, and then Ss can look up the meaning and review with their partner on the flashcard app. Ss can check pronunciation as needed.📕📕📕 T asks Ss for meaning.
<p>
4. In pairs, Ss try to match the target words to the synonyms written in the app as a review. 🙋🏻🙋🏻🙋🏻

   <td>1. T activates Ss’ previous knowledge and motivates them by using the pictures to draw their attention to the lesson contents.
<p>
2. Through the image made by the Wordcloud app (for T convenience), Ss can predict what will happen in the story and see what vocabulary words they will encounter in advance. This will lower Ss’ affective filter when learning new vocabulary and hearing a new story.
<p>
3. Using the flashcard app, Ss can check not only the meaning but also the pronunciation of the target words by themselves. It promotes student-centered learning and accommodates learning at various proficiency levels because they can repeat what they are not sure of. Further, T can ask Ss for meaning to check Ss’ understanding.
<p>
4. Ss can review and test their understanding of the target vocabulary through this synonym matching activity. It’s also repetition.

5. First Listen: T uses TTS to have Ss listen to the story and listen for the main idea.T asks Ss question: What is Maria's dream? Did you guess correctly? 👂🏼👂🏼👂🏼
<p>
6. 2nd Listen: T reviews T/F questions and Ss listen to the story again and then Ss answer true and false questions with their partner.  👂🏼👂🏼👂🏼
<p>
7. Third Listen: T reviews comprehension questions for the review quiz and then Ss listen to the story again for details. Then Ss take a quiz with their partner.👂🏼👂🏼👂🏼 T briefly goes over the answers with whole class.
<p>
(Teacher can replay the listening text when Ss ask during step 6-7)
<p>
8. Speed Recall: In groups of 4, Ss are given sentences that match events from the story and try to put them in the correct order using Jigsaw sentence rearrangement app.📝📝📝

   <td>There are 3 steps of listening activities for scaffolding (task sequencing), which is also pair work for lower affective filter. The teacher also explains and instructs by showing Ss each app with directions.
<p>
5. Ss listen to the story for the main idea as a first step. T will use TTS to have Ss listen to the story, which is easy and simple to use. It saves time since the T doesn’t have to find audio files on their own.
<p>
6. For the second step of listening, T/F Quiz activity will help Ss listen more carefully to understand the overall story. T pauses the listening halfway through to make the listening easier for students to follow and answer questions. (scaffolding)
<p>
7. As a last step of listening, students listen for details. The comprehension quiz will help Ss pay better attention to details when listening to the story, and Ss can check their understanding through it with help from a partner.
<p>
As further scaffolding, T will replay the listening text when Ss ask.
<p>
8. Ss can work collaboratively to put the events of the story in the correct order. It will solidify their understanding of the story while also using context clues.

   <td>9. As an extension of learning, Ss will connect the lesson contents to their real life. It will make the task more authentic, and Ss will be highly interested and motivated because Ss can generate their own image created by themselves using technology. Ss will also appreciate the benefits of technology through  this task, increasing their digital literacy. Additionally, the teacher models the task so the Ss understand the expectations.

10. Showing the Ss a T example will lower their affective filters while writing and preparing for the presentation.
