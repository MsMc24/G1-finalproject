(2m) 1. T asks the Ss to look at the title and pictures from the story and asks Ss to guess and predict what the story is about.☁️☁️☁️
<p>
(2m) 2. T generates a word cloud for Ss (made using Wordcloud app). It emphasizes that the biggest words are the most mentioned keywords in the story. 
<p>
<em>What do you think Maria’s dream job is (related to <strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">art</span></strong>)? What does she need to achieve her dream?</em> 
<p>
(6m) 3. T previews the target vocabulary and asks what words Ss may know, and then Ss can look up the meaning and review with their partner on the flashcard app. Ss can check pronunciation as needed.📕📕📕 T asks Ss for meaning.
<p>
(5m) 4. In pairs, Ss try to match the target words to the synonyms written in the app as a review. 🙋🏻🙋🏻🙋🏻

(4m) 5. First Listen: T uses TTS to have Ss listen to the story and listen for the main idea.T asks Ss question: What is Maria's dream? Did you guess correctly? 👂🏼👂🏼👂🏼
<p>
(6m) 6. 2nd Listen: T reviews T/F questions, and shows Ss the app. Then Ss listen to the story again (stopping halfway through to let Ss answer before finishing) and then Ss answer true and false questions with their partner. If the answer if false, Ss discuss with partner what information to change to make it true 👂🏼👂🏼👂🏼
<p>
(6m) 7. Third Listen: T reviews comprehension questions for the review quiz and then Ss listen to the story again for details. Then Ss take a quiz with their partner.👂🏼👂🏼👂🏼 T briefly goes over the answers with whole class.

## ⭐️Tips:
+ Check the links before class so that all the apps are ready to be used by the students.
+ Students may need help with the apps.
+ Pair/Group struggling students with higher-proficiency students.
+ Check with other Python-users if you're uncertain how to make a code work.

**<Synopsis>**
In the village of Lila, the "Tree of Dreams" was said to make dreams come true, a legend mostly regarded as a children's tale. Maria, a poor but talented young artist, inspired by this legend, whispered her wish to the tree for help in a national art competition. Miraculously, she received a donation of art supplies the next day. Using these, she created a winning painting of the Tree of Dreams, earning a scholarship and transforming her and her village's belief in the power of dreams, thus reaffirming the tree's magical reputation as a beacon of hope and inspiration.
