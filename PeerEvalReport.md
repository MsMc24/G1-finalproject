# 💙 Peer Evaluation Review (0619, by MK316)

First and foremost, I want to commend you all on the innovative and engaging way you integrated technology into language learning. The use of various apps to make lessons interactive and fun has clearly made a positive impact. Your approach to scaffolding was particularly effective, providing clear guidance and making it easier for students to engage with the material.
(Personally, it was great to see you providing language prompts for student activities when asking them to use generative AIs. This is an important aspect when teachers employ generative AI tools in their classrooms. 👍👍👍)

However, there were some insightful suggestions that could further enhance your teaching approach. For instance, it was noted that having students read questions aloud during presentations could increase engagement and confidence. While the nervousness of a mock lesson might have affected this aspect, it's something to consider incorporating more deliberately in future sessions. It was also suggested that showing how students can apply and participate with the apps during the lessons could be more illustrative. Furthermore, providing more concrete online feedback mechanisms post-class would support continuous learning and engagement.
The overall structure of the lesson was appreciated, though there were points raised about the lesson not entirely breaking away from traditional formats and possibly missing out on leveraging the full strengths of online education. Additionally, maintaining immersion without the teacher having to navigate away from the main content was highlighted as an area for improvement.

In summary, your group did an excellent job at demonstrating the potential of AI and coding in education. There is always room for growth, and the constructive feedback provided is invaluable for refining your teaching strategies. Keep exploring and innovating—your dedication is paving the way for exciting educational experiences.

## Essay feedback 1: _What do you think are the most valuable lessons from that group's presentation?_

||Comments|
|--|--|
|1|I think the most valuable lesson is that if I can think of it, it's probably possible with coding! I would love to learn how to connect LMS to the apps!|
|2|The firtst activty can make student understand vocabulary meaning and pronunciation at the same time.
학생들을 위한 Scaffolding이 잘 설계되어 있었다. Students 페이지를 통해서 학생들이 해야할 것들이 한 눈에 보이고 각 앱을 어떻게 사용하는지 instruction이 잘 적혀 있었고 선생님도 데모를 통해 잘 보여주었다.|
|3|Give a template as scaffolding to write a promt to make their own image through AI|
|4|Using various applications and technological tools makes learning more engaging and fun.|
|5|Flashcard app was very impressive. I think it’s very helpful for students and easy to use.|
|6|With appropriate level (easy to difficult), students can easily follow the class.|
|7|포스트 액티비티|
|8|Post listening part was the most valuable to me because learners can share their ideas.|
|9|확실한 교육 목표를 세우고 이에 맞게 차근차근 수업을 진행하는 것이 좋았습니다.|
|10|In the last, student generate the new images and the output was outstanding. Using the AI app for the class was offering real-time feedback and additional resources. And the scaffolding of the process was very good.|
|11|Group work! I feel thankful to my group members for the helping and guiding towards the final project.|
|12|Great lesson plan structure. 음원을 여러 번 듣는 기회가 있어 좋았고, 점차 난이도를 높인 부분도 좋았음. 이미지 생성을 scaffolding 과 함께 초보자도 누구나 쉽게 할 수 있게 해주어 학생들이 흥미를 갖고 참여할 수 있을 것 같음.|
|13|I liked the scaffolding process of making students immerse themselves in the content by listening to the text several times.|
|14|I think Engagement was the most impressive part as the teacher kept making sure with questions if the students understood and the students followed well after the instructions.|
