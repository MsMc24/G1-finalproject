## Introduction:

Using web applications in the classroom instead of traditional paper-based materials in the language classroom is more efficient and effective in the digital age. First, it’s more accessible and convenient for both teachers and students. Teachers can easily access their created code and edit the material as needed for each class so that it meets learning styles and needs of a particular class. For example, Teachers can easily create a word cloud for students to predict the story. Also, students can access class material anywhere and at any time once it’s put on an interface like hugging space. Using materials online with python code, already makes the material more interactive with quizzes and multimedia content like ai generated images. Additionally, having the teacher run some of the code on the projector (like TTS for listening to the story), gets the students interested, active, and attentive. Using apps creates overall ease for the teacher. In addition, digital content is more dynamic and engaging for students, leading to more motivation to learn. 

•	Our lesson is listening lesson plan about The Tree of Dreams. By the end of the class, Ss will be able to listen for specific information in a story, Ss will be able to recall information from the story, and Ss will be able to generate an image using their own descriptive words. 
<br>Our lesson is scaffolding by giving pair work, going from general to detailed, with written directions, and lots of repetition as well as modelling from the teacher. We have 5 apps meant to give the Ss a diverse number of interactions with the different types of python coding apps. Our lesson plan page has more details about the rationale behind each stage of the lesson so please check it out later when you have time. We also created a separate student page for students to access and follow along easily, whereas the T can access the coding page.

## Conclusion: 

As you can see, using Python to create materials for the classroom offers the benefit of versatility as there is a wide range beyond even the programs we created for this lesson. Though it has a learning curve, the readability of Python makes it accessible for teachers to create a wide range of revisable educational materials so that class never becomes boring. In a digital age, it is crucial for teachers to constantly evolve with technology use. Overall, using web applications and Python programming in the classroom can significantly enhance the efficiency, effectiveness, and engagement of teaching and learning activities, ultimately leading to better learning outcomes for students. With older students, a teacher could even eventually incorporate teaching the students some python code (if the interest is there), leading students to feel that they are truly taking charge of their own learning, leading to more autonomous learners.
